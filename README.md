# MobBows

![](https://media.forgecdn.net/avatars/66/687/636163070562140628.png)

## Info
This was my second Bukkit plugin that I released on [BukkitDev](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/mobbows), for Minecraft version 1.7.9 and 1.5.2.
This plugin adds recipes for custom bow items that, when shot, fire a mob of the chosen type. 

### This plugin will not be updated to any future versions of Minecraft. For any inquiries, feel free to contact me personally.
